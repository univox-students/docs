## Committee email and editing content
All accounts used for the development of the website uses the WCR External Affairs email.
```
wcr.externalaffairs@univ.ox.ac.uk
```
Please make sure that you have access to this email account. If not, please ask the current/previous committee to send a request to the College IT Support on behalf of you.
```
it@univ.ox.ac.uk
```

!!! tip
    
    You may find it more convenient to request both access to the WCR External Affairs email and the College server at the same time.

You should also ensure that you are able to login to the CMS as a *Super Admin*. You may be able to do so by the above WCR External Affairs email, or any other WCR committee emails that have Super Admin access.


## Github codespace
You should have **owner** access to the [University College Oxford Students](https://github.com/univox-students) Github association. Please create a Github account if you do not have one, after then you can request access from the previous committee who has owner access.

!!! tip
    
    You may wish to sign up with the [Student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack). This will give you access to Github pro, which includes many benefits e.g. Github Copilot (AI code generator).

The Github association is expected to have many members, so it is important to organise the members into teams. Please add yourself, or ask other WCR members with owner access to add you to the **WCR Committee** team.

!!! note "External Documentation"

    Please refer to the official Github documentation on 

    - [how to invite users to join your organisation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-membership-in-your-organization/inviting-users-to-join-your-organization), and
    - [adding organization members to a team](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/adding-organization-members-to-a-team).

Finally, you should also receive from the previous committee the login credential for the WCR Github account `univox-wcr`. 

!!! info

    In case you need to recover the account, you may do so by using the WCR external affairs email.

!!! warning
    
    We kindly ask you to avoid enabling two-factor authentication for the `univox-wcr` account for now, as this will make the handover process difficult.

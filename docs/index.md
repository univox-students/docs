# WCR Website

## About
The Weir Common Room (WCR) is the Middle Common Room of the University College, Oxford, representing all the graduate students in the University College. The WCR is also the physical space in the College where graduate students can relax and socialise.

The WCR is finally having its website again since 2019, as a celebration of the end of Covid and the revival of the postgraduate community of the University College, Oxford.

# WCR Website

## About
The Weir Common Room (WCR) is the Middle Common Room of the University College, Oxford, representing all the graduate students in the University College (Univ). The WCR is also the physical space in the College where graduate students can relax and socialise.

[The website](https://wcr.univ.ox.ac.uk), together with [other initatives](introduction/index.md), are part of the WCR effort to build a more closely-knit postgraduate community in Univ, to connect postgraduates with other parts of the college, and to improve the public appearance of the WCR.

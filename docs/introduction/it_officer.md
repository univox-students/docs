# Do we need an IT officer to manage the current website?
- The website has been designed so that relevant officers could edit their parts of the website easily using our content management systems.
- The website *will* be hosted by a virtual server, maintained by the college. Access of the server could be obtained from the college IT officer.
- Under the current constitution, the maintanance of the website is led by the secretary. We propose setting up a dedicated committee role for the *technical* maintanance of the WCR website.

## Expected commitment of an IT officer
- taking the lead to maintain and update the WCR website; 
- liaise between the WCR and College IT Officers about matters arising from the computing services provided by either the College or University; 
- ensure the content of the website is accurate and up to date and to promote the usage of the website by the members of the WCR;
- (work with the College Communication and Development Offices) to ensure that the website complies with the College branding guides.
- (work with the WCR Students with Disabilities and Accessibility Officer and the College disability officers) to ensure the website is accessible by the members of the WCR;
- add features requested by the WCR to the website, or work with the WCR to find a compromise that can be implemented should a suggested feature is unfeasible.
- maintain a documentation for the management of the WCR website.

## Benefit of having an IT officer?
- Setting up this post **encourages** IT involvements.
- Website maintanace could be very technical (e.g. making sure contents are in line with accessibility regulations and branding guidelines), hence imposing extra burden for the secretary who already has a bit of commitments.
- JCR has an IT officer. Setting up a WCR counterpart encourages collaborations, and would: 
    - enhance promotion of activities (e.g. arts, music, sports), and
    - help lobbying initiatives for better college communications (e.g. meal times and menus etc.)

## Myth/concerns having an IT officer

### Huge overlap with the secretary roles. 
- IT officer is here to help the secretary. 
- IT officer could focus with the development of features, instead of taking up works that secretary are normally doing.

### Committee now have to contact with one extra person
- You can edit the contents by yourselves most of the time, e.g. editing your own profile page, or putting up an events.
- The management of the website could be further decentralised (so that you don't need to reach the IT officer), with the expense that the source code looks uglier though :( .

### Website is difficult to handover
- The website will be hosted by the college server, so granting access to the IT officer only involves contacting college IT officer to add access. 
- The process could actually be simplified under college IT officers' permission if we are able to come up with a fair-use policy.
- Technicalities should be well-documented in this documentation, so they could refer to this if there are minor/intermediate issues.

### It would be difficult to find someone to fill up this position
- It will be even harder to find someone to manage this website if we do not have the post in the first place.

# Motion to add the role of Website and Communication Officer into WCR committee
The motion, to be proposed in the Week 5/6 Ordinary General Meeting, will formally add the role of *Website and Communication Officer* to the WCR committee. The change will be in effect when the motion was passed, and the revised constitution has been approved by the Governing body.

## The Univ WCR notes that
1.  A [website](https://wcr.univ.ox.ac.uk) (hereinafter referred to as the **WCR Website**) has been setup to replace [*the Weir Common Room* section](https://www.univ.ox.ac.uk/live-at-univ/the-weir-common-room/) of the official Univ website.
1.  The WCR Website is currently hosted by a virtual server managed by the College IT Office (hereinafter referred to as the **College Server**).
1.  The WCR Website is designed so that relevant WCR officers could edit their parts of the website easily using our content management systems.
1.  An interim WCR Committee member is currently responsible for the technical development and maintenance of the WCR Website. The technical maintenance responsibility is to be handed over to the WCR Secretary under the provision of Section 5.5(c) of the WCR Constitution.
> 5.5 The Secretary's duties shall include: <br/>
> ... <br/>
> c) managing the WCR website.
1.  In previous years, the WCR will publish introductions of the WCR Committee as a news article on the official official Univ website with the assistance of the College Digital Communication Office (hereinafter referred to as the **College DCO**).
1.  The Junior Common Room (hereinafter referred to the **JCR**) IT Officer is currently responsible for maintaining the JCR website.
1.  The College DCO has been working with JCR and WCR to streamline event promotion and freshers' experience.

## The Univ WCR believes that
1.  A dedicated Univ WCR website could improve the online presence of the WCR, and enhance communication among the College officials, WCR Committee, WCR members (including incoming freshers), alumni, donors and the general public.
1.  Therefore, the WCR should safeguard the long-term development for its website.
1.  Website development and maintenance could be very technical (e.g. making sure contents are in line with accessibility regulations and branding guidelines), hence imposing extra burden for the secretary who already has a bit of commitments.
1.  Setting up a new WCR Committee role dedicated to the WCR Website is the key to the continuous development of the WCR Website, as well as any other initatives that could improve WCR online presence.
1.  The new WCR Committee could work with the JCR IT Officer and the College DCO to improve the College's online presence, and to streamline College communications.

## The Univ WCR resolves to
1.  Enact a new role in the WCR Committee for the development and maintenance of the WCR website. Any WCR member filling in this new role will enjoy all benefits as a standard WCR Committee member. The new role shall be called the **Website and Communication Officer**.

## Q&A
1. Huge overlap with the secretary roles?
> A: The Website and Communication Officer could focus with the development of features, instead of taking up works that secretary are normally doing.

1. Committee now have to contact with one extra person?
> A: You can edit the contents by yourselves most of the time, e.g. editing your own profile page, or putting up an events. The Digital Communication Officer would communicate with the College DCO for updates in the official College website.

1. Can we further decentralise the management of the website?
> A: As a result of decentralisation, the source code will be harder to maintain.

1. How to ensure smooth handover?
> A: The website is currently hosted on the College server, so granting access to the new Website and Communication Officer or Secretary would only involve contacting college IT officer to add access. Technicalities should be well-documented in this documentation, so they could refer to this if there are minor/intermediate issues.

1. We can hardly find anyone to fill this role?
> A: It will be even harder to find someone to manage this website if we do not have the post in the first place. I am happy to host generic website trainings (fun fact: the University provide a webspace for all student and staff members).

1. What is the recommended length of handover?
> A: There should be a **one** term handover period between the incoming and outgoing Website and Communication Officers, to ensure the non-incumbent officer understands both their role and the inner workings of the website.

1. Where do you take references the new role?
> A: The terms of references are taken from the [Univ JCR Standing Order](https://www.univjcr.com/_files/ugd/8c6179_61a838da185943f9bedc8752d999e18f.pdf) - see Appendix A item 11.

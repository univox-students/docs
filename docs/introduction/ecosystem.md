# Bring the community together
We are building a new ecosystem to bring all college communities together. The ecosystem is centered around the common room websites, which provide information about what's going on around the college. The common room websites are supplemented by a decentralised social media platform tailor-made for our college community, as well as a streamlined fresher's experience.

## Common Rooms Websites
The common room websites contain the following information:

- objective statements
- WCR room details
- list of events (What's on)
- list of college societies that welcome graduate memberships
- profile pages for current and previous committee
- constitution PDF
- overview of welfare provisions

[Please view this page for more details about the website.](/introduction/structure)

## A decentralised social media platform
Ad-free and respecting your attention, [univox.social](https://univox.social) is a social media platform built by Tom Campbell, the 2023-24 JCR LGBTQ+ officer. This platform is run by members of the college, independent from any social media company, making the platform truly ethical and tailor-made for our community.

The current platform is currently for undergraduates (JCR members) only, but we see this a valuable platform for both the WCR and other societies to promote themselves. We would like to therefore build a WCR community in this platform, and to encourage announcements to be made via this platform alongside with the popular WhatsApp communities.

## Streamlining fresher's experience
We would like to streamline the fresher's experience by connecting them to various communities (common room, college families and societies) as soon as possible. We therefore propose:

### Extended college parents scheme
We have been asking new members of the college about their hobbies. With their permission, we could leverage these information to connect the members to the relevant societies.

### Fresher's timetable on the WCR
The PDF fresher's timetable could be replaced by the What's on page of the WCR.

### Interactive map of the college
We will develop an interactive college map.

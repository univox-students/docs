# Bring the community together
We are committed to build a new ecosystem to bring various college communities together. The ecosystem is centered around the common room websites, which provide information about what's going on around the college. The common room websites are supplemented by a decentralised social media platform tailor-made for our college community, as well as a streamlined fresher's experience.

## Common Rooms Websites
The current table lists all the sections in the current WCR website, with plans for further developments:
- green Check (✅) emoji for completed updates (for this year),
- siren (🚨) emoji for essential updates, and 
- plus (+) sign for proposed long-term updates.

## Community+
The following list proposed additional initiatives that would potentially benefit our WCR community. They are, however, optional and independent of the development of the website.

### Streamlining fresher's experience
We would like to streamline the fresher's experience by connecting them to various communities (common room, college families and societies) as soon as possible. We will therefore 

- **make our fresher's timetable online** by using the content management system, and
- **providing an online map** for the college freshers' fair.

### Webspace for student societies
We propose to provide a web space for student societies for further promotion. Websites are hosted on the [University College Oxford Students GitHub organisation](https://github.com/univox-students) as a subpage of [univox-students.github.io](https://univox-students.github.io) (page currently inactive). 

- We will **enact a policy to moderate** the contents posted via the GitHub organisation.
- We may consider registering a **more professional domain** from the College, e.g. [societies.univ.ox.ac.uk](https://societies.univ.ox.ac.uk) as a subdomain of the College website ([univ.ox.ac.uk](https://univ.ox.ac.uk)), subject to the agreements from College staff and JCR.

### Requesting a dedicated Sharepoint site
WCR could request a Microsoft Sharepoint site to manage files and documentations. This looks much neater, and won't take up your personal Google Drive spaces (my Google Drive is getting full soon)!

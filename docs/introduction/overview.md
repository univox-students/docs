# Bring the community together
We are committed to build a new ecosystem to bring various college communities together. The ecosystem is centered around the common room websites, which provide information about what's going on around the college. The common room websites are supplemented by a decentralised social media platform tailor-made for our college community, as well as a streamlined fresher's experience.

## Common Rooms Websites
The current table lists all the sections in the current WCR website, with plans for further developments. Items with the siren (ðŸš¨) emoji are essential updates, and items with plus (+) sign are proposed updates.

## Community+
The following list proposed additional initiatives that would potentially benefit our WCR community. They are, however, optional and independent of the development of the website.

### Streamlining fresher's experience
We would like to streamline the fresher's experience by connecting them to various communities (common room, college families and societies) as soon as possible. We therefore propose:

- **Making our fresher's timetable online** by using the content management system.
- **Providing online map** for the college freshers' fair.
- **Extending our college parents scheme:** We have been asking new members of the college about their hobbies. With their permission, we could leverage these information to connect the members to the relevant college societies/communities.

### Requesting a dedicated Sharepoint site
WCR could request a Microsoft Sharepoint site to manage files and documentations. This looks much neater, and won't take up your personal Google Drive spaces (my Google Drive is getting full soon)!

### College dedicated social media that respects your attention!
Ad-free and respecting your attention, [univox.social](https://univox.social) is a social media platform built by Tom Campbell, the incoming JCR IT officer. This platform is run by members of the college, independent from any social media company, making the platform truly ethical and tailor-made for our community.

The current platform is currently for undergraduates (JCR members) only, but we see this a valuable platform for both the WCR and other societies to promote themselves. We would like to therefore build a WCR community in this platform, and to encourage announcements to be made via this platform alongside with the popular WhatsApp communities.

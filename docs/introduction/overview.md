## Bring the community together
The WCR website and the associated initiatives provide accurate information of the WCR and the wider college community that are accessible to all WCR members, with the aim 

- to build a more closely-knit postgraduate community in Univ,
- to connect postgraduates with other college communities;
- to honour postgraduate members of the College in shaping the College community; and
- to streamline freshers experience; and
- to improve appearance of WCR to the alumni, donors and the general public, leading to more supports of the work of WCR in fostering the College community.

# Maintenance of the WCR webpage
This section is to be completed. The maintenance of the WCR webpage includes:

- updating events and societies information frequently by [visiting the admin panel](https://samuelchlam.herokuapp.com/admin) using your official email,
- directly editing the website by [visting the Github repository of the webpage](https://github.com/univox-students/wcr)
- updating this documentation by [visting the Github repository of the documentation](https://github.com/univox-students/univox-students.github.io).

## Temporary measures
- The frontend of the website is written in React.js, and is hosted as a Github page ([univox-students.github.io/wcr](univox-students.github.io/wcr)).
- The backend of the website (content manager, server codes and database) is provided by Strapi, and is hosted by Heroku.
- The documentation of the website is purely Markdown, generated by the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), and is also hosted as a Github page ([univox-students.github.io](univox-students.github.io/wcr)).

## Permanent Measure
- The frontend and backend of the website will be hosted by the college (Linux) server at [wcr.univ.ox.ac.uk]().
- The temporary frontend ([univox-students.github.io/wcr](univox-students.github.io/wcr)) will be kept.
- The documentation of the website will continue to be hosted at ([univox-students.github.io](univox-students.github.io/wcr)).

## Setup checklist
You may wish to install the following for development.

- Node.js for frontend.
- Strapi for backend.
- Python with MkDocs package for documentation.
